<h1>What is the Eisenhower matrix?</h1>
<h5 class="padding-32" style="text-align: justify">
In today's fast-paced society, the urgency to complete some tasks
quickly gives the activity a false sense of importance, and people
often tend to clutter their to-do lists. The Eisenhower Matrix is a
novel approach to task prioritization and productivity.
</h5>
<p class="text-grey" style="text-align: justify">
Tasks are segregated into four different quadrants. The 1st quadrant
holds urgent and important tasks. The 2nd quadrant holds important
but not urgent tasks. The 3rd quadrant contains tasks that are not
important but urgent. The 4th quadrant contains tasks that are
neither urgent nor important.

<h1>How do you use the Eisenhower Matrix?</h1>
<h5 class="padding-32" style="text-align: justify">
Include tasks that have a clear deadline and come with consequences
for not completing them, in the first quadrant. The second quadrant
emphasizes long-term objectives. The third quadrant is reserved for
those tasks that have a deadline but do not bring you closer to your
goals. Tasks that add to procrastination go into the fourth
quadrant.
</h5>
<p class="text-grey" style="text-align: justify">
It is suggested to DO the first quadrant tasks right away, DECIDE
the second quadrant tasks for completion at the appropriate time,
DELEGATE the third quadrant tasks, and DELETE i.e. do not do the
fourth quadrant tasks and avoid them as much as possible.
